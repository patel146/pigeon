Installation
------------
Download the Qt5 installer first from http://qt-project.org/downloads
Install Qt5. Your home directory is fine.
Download and install SIP.
Download and install PyQt.
- When running confi`gure.py, you'll want to use the --qmake flag to point to where the utility qmake is. This will be in your Qt install directory; see the README in your Qt directory for details on where it is.

You may have to change your PYTHONPATH enviroment variable to point to the place in your system that PyQt5 is installed in order to use the module.
This can be done by putting
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/install/directory":$PYTHONPATH
in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file.

To check your PYTHONPATH, open up a python session and type in:
import sys
print(sys.path)
